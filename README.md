Freedom-Fighter--Lexington-and-Concord
======================================

An epic tower defense game unlike any other!

Battle your way to victory with artillery, gunmen, and infantry! Defeat great and powerful elite British soldiers and tough officers with the power to spur on their comrads and make them fight harder!

This is not anything like Bloons, Kingdom Rush, PvZ, or any other brand-name tower defense game; no, this is a whole new approach to the classic and addicting strategy game of Tower Defense!

Gore? NO! Never in Freedom Fighter: Lexington & Concord! Entirely clean!

Is there any way to learn history without listening to boring lectures or taking repetitive and banal quizzes? The answer, my friends, is yes, there is such a way! Enter Freedom Fighter: Lexington & Concord! You can earn extra funds by answering questions, you can read cool facts about the American War for Independance and the great men who took part in it, or you can even simply learn about history from the game itself, which is based largely on the actual battles!
