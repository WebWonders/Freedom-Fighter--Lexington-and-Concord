    	<p>Freedom Fighter: Lexington &#38; Concord is a <a id="wikiRef" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">Tower Defense</a> game about the famous American battles of the War for Independance, based on the two specific battles of Lexington &#38; Concord.</p>
    	<p>Battle your way to victory with artillery, gunmen, and infantry! Defeat great and powerful elite British soldiers and tough officers with the power to spur on their comrads and make them fight harder!</p>
		<p>This is not anything like Bloons, Kingdom Rush, PvZ, or any other major tower defense game; no, this is a whole new approach to the classic and addicting strategy game of Tower Defense!</p>

    <div class="menuDiv" id="how2play" width="700" height="675">
        <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Place American soldiers on the board to try to stop the British troops from getting to their destinations</li>
            <li>All the towers cost money, so budget wisely!</li>
            <li>You can get money from killing the British troops and from civilian donations (randomly given, occasionally)</li>
            <li>There are three types of towers; gunmen, infantry, and artillery</li>
            <li>The gunmen hide behind trees or just sit on the side of the road and take out the British</li>
            <li>The infantry walk on the road and fight hand-to-hand with the British - these are best used to slow down the enemies so that the gunmen and artillery can finish them off</li>
            <li>The artillery shoot bombs and such, dealing large amounts of area damage to all enemies nearby</li>
        </ul>
