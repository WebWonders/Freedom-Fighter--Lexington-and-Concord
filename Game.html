        <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Place American soldiers on the board to try to stop the British troops from getting to their destinations</li>
            <li>All the towers cost money, so budget wisely!</li>
            <li>You can get money from killing the British troops and from civilian donations (randomly given, occasionally)</li>
            <li>There are three types of towers; gunmen, infantry, and artillery</li>
            <li>The gunmen hide behind trees or just sit on the side of the road and take out the British</li>
            <li>The infantry walk on the road and fight hand-to-hand with the British - these are best used to slow down the enemies so that the gunmen and artillery can finish them off</li>
            <li>The artillery shoot bombs and such, dealing large amounts of area damage to all enemies nearby</li>
        </ul>
